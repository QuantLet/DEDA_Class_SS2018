Description: Use Multinomial Logistic Regression (LogReg) to predict the Outcome of the Games of the World Cup Matches 2018. Predictions are based on historical results since 1993. Predictions were adapted after the Group Stages with the teams that actually passed on to the Knockout Stages, including all the games played so far in the World Cup into the Training/Test data. The same was done after the Quarterfinals.
